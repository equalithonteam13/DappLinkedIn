Blockchain solution aimed at helping Fintech firms more effectively identify, attract and retain diverse workers.

Nasdaq Challenge #2

Many people suffer from an imposter syndrome, especially employees from minority backgrounds. This syndrome prevents them from behaving in a way that enables them to come through as experts in the eyes of their colleagues. Additionally, the same groups of people can be subject to unconscious biases from peers and managers. One of the impacts of these biases is to make it harder for the minority-sourced employee to be recognized as an expert in their field. How can the various properties of the Blockchain support an HR tool or module that can source, track and secure information that is irrefutable proof of a personâ€™s expertise based on education, factual achievements, peer feedback and references?

----
We developed an application that allows employees to review their accomplishments which can help combat imposter syndrome. Employers will be able to confirm the history of work, education, and skills of an employee at any company with little to no additional bias.
